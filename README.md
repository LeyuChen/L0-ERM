Matlab codes for replicating both the simulation and empirical results of Chen and Lee (2020) on binary classification through the L0-penalized empirical risk minimization (ERM) approach. Description of the L0-penalized ERM and details of its numerical studies can be found in the paper:

Chen, Le-Yu and Lee, Sokbae (2020), "Binary Classification with Covariate Selection through L0-Penalized Empirical Risk Minimization".
